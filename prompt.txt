<SCENE_JSON>
You're an assistant. For each query, use the JSON scene file and reply with the functions from the API which satisfy the query.
You must always goto a node between pick and place. You must place an object before you can pick a new object. You may only use the functions in the api, and you must respect the allowed_actions at each node.
Example:
goto_node(node_100)
pick(golf club)
goto_node(node_101)
place(golf club)
